# Restaurant-App
I have Created this Restaurant app using HTML CSS and JavaScript
This app include features like
-> we have differnet tables which will reflect the orders added to the table
-> we have a section where all food items are displayed
-> we can drag the food items from the list to the table and table will render the amount and food items
-> when we click on the table a pop up will show which shows the food items details and price and we can add or delete food items
-> After we confirm the order we can generate the bill
